**Paypal and online integration needed server hosting and was not really a feature I wanted so I left it out in the end.
**Images were crawled from the Internet and are not to be used by any third party.
***Ideas and schema for site learned by Udemy Instrutor Abdul Wali
**All Content is not to be used for commercial purposes, this project was made for academic purposes ONLY

I do admit the database integration for this site can be improved upon. As I am just now learning database management I am creating a better database through implementation of a different project. Hopefully I might have time to make similar changes to this project.
